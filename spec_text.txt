Specification: Letter-Sequence Reading Trainer
1. Purpose
A browser-based tool that helps children learn to read by constructing words letter-by-letter from a word list. The interface progressively filters available letters based on what can follow the current sequence. The app also incorporates phonetic letter sounds, speech recognition for reading aloud, and a log of completed words.

2. User Workflow
Initial Screen
Large empty sequence display.
Full alphabet grid.
Selecting a Letter
Letter appears at the top.
The phonetic sound of the letter plays immediately.
The grid updates to show only valid next letters.
Building a Word
User continues selecting letters.
If the current sequence matches any complete word in the list:
Display highlights the word as complete.
A button appears: “Read this word”.
Reading the Word (Speech Recognition)
When the user presses “Read this word”:
App activates speech recognition.
User says the word aloud.
If the spoken result matches the target word:
Confetti animation plays.
The word is added to a “Completed Words Log”.
A prompt appears: “Start a new word?”
If incorrect:
A gentle audio cue indicates mismatch.
Backtracking
“Back” removes the last letter.
Grid updates accordingly.
Resetting
“Clear” clears the entire sequence and restores the full alphabet.
Settings View
Text area for editing the word list.
Text area showing completed words.
Option to clear completed-word log.
Audio toggle (letter sounds on/off, speech recognition prompts on/off).

3. Main Features
3.1 Letter Sound Playback
On each letter click, play its phoneme.
Store short audio files for each letter (mp3 or wav) or use Web Speech Synthesis with per-letter phoneme mappings.
3.2 Prefix-Based Letter Filtering
The app reduces the grid to valid next letters using the prefix map.
3.3 Detection of Completed Words
If prefix matches a word in the dictionary:
Apply a visual highlight.
Display a “Read this word” button.
3.4 Speech Recognition for Word Completion
Use Web Speech API (when available).
Speech recognizer listens for a single utterance.
Compare recognized word to the target prefix.
Basic tolerance for minor pronunciation variations (normalizing case, stripping spaces).
3.5 Success Acknowledgment
Confetti burst animation overlay on success.
Spoken or text message such as “Well done”.
3.6 Completion Log
Maintain a persistent log in localStorage.
Display log in the settings panel.
Provide “Clear Log” button.
3.7 Word List Management
Editable via settings.
Stored in localStorage.
Rebuild prefix map on save.
